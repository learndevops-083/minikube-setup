An introduction to minikube

Minikube is an open source tool that was developed to enable developers and system administrators to run a single cluster of Kubernetes on their local machine. Minikube starts a single node kubernetes cluster locally with small resource utilization. This is ideal for development tests and POC purposes.
//ensure docker is installed.follow this guide on how to install docker 

Step 1: Update system

Run the following commands to update all system packages to the latest release:

 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install apt-transport-https
 sudo apt upgrade
If a reboot is required after the upgrade then perform the process.

[ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] && sudo reboot -f

Step 2: Install KVM or VirtualBox Hypervisor
For VirtualBox users, install VirtualBox using:

sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack

Step 3: Download minikube on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04
You need to download the minikube binary. I will put the binary under /usr/local/bin directory since it is inside $PATH.

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
chmod +x minikube-linux-amd64
sudo mv minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

N/B create user on your ubuntu machine that will run the minikube service as you can start minikube as a root user.add that user to the docker group
this is to assume you have docker installed and configured properly.
useradd devops; mkdir -p /home/devops/
##add user to docker group 
sudo usermod -aG docker devops
